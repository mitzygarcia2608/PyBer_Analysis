The above images show some key findings from the analysis:
 
 •	Urban cities provide the most total revenue at $39,854.38 , however Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride
 
 •	Urban cities account for the highest total number of rides at 1,625 rides and the highest total amount of drivers at 2,405 drivers
 
 •	Rural cites have only 78 total drivers but the earn approx. 3xs more than the drivers in the urban cities.
 
 •	Suburban cities have an average fare per driver that is aligned with the average fare per ride



# Summay:

My following reccomendations for Pyber are based on the above information and analysis of Pyber data:

•	Focus on Rural areas , these seemed to be the most underserved and with the lowest amount of affordablity

•	Providing incentives such as discounts on first ride for those in rural area could help increase the number of rides in those cities.

•	Providing incentives for drivers can also help increase the number of drivers , for example providing incentives for drivers urban drivers to take more rides in rural cities
